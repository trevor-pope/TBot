# TBot
A simple discord.py bot. Contains various fun commands such as using a thesaurus or rhyming dictionary, displaying an emote tally, and having simple conversations.




## Instructions
1) Create an App.
    Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and click create a new app.
   
2) Make it a bot.
    On the left, click "Bot" and create a new Bot. You can adjust it's username and profile picture here.

3) Record the token.
    On the same screen, click "Copy" underneath Token and write it down somewhere safe. Do not reveal this token to anyone else.

4) Invite the bot to your server.
   On the left, click "OAuth2" and select bot as a scope. You may also adjust the bot permissions. Then, copy and paste the given    link into your browser, and invite the bot to a server that you're in.
   
5) Clone the repository (or download it manually by clicking this [link](https://github.com/trevor-pope/TBot/archive/master.zip) and unzipping the file).

6) Install Python by following the instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to install PIP as well, and add Python to the PATH variable. TBot runs on an older version (3.6) of Python, but can still work with the most recent version (3.7).

7) After installing Python, run ```initial_setup.py``` by opening the command prompt, navigating to the folder its in, and typing ```python -m initial_setup```.

8) The setup will setup everything autmatically, and launch the bot for you. You can close the bot and relaunch it later by entering ```python -m tbot```
